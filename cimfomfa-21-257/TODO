-  have window mode in hashfile:
      keep a constant number of entries in the hash, removing the older
      entries in order. (to stress-test hashes, in conjunction with const)

-  rewrite peach.c
   make it use a braindead grammar (basic "\n .." etc assumptions)
   comments ? mm difficult.

/  remove util, install it using libzwik.
-  clean up hashfile, clean up sorting, enable -r, -u.
-  make --stats option.
